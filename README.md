# az-python
Python code with respect to Azure and AI scenarios for learning, sharing and proof of concepts.

This repo has code samples to complement my blog post series - https://roykim.ca/2023/11/13/step-by-step-using-azure-sdk-for-python-in-windows-vs-code-part-1/

I demonstrate using Azure SDK for Python to create a storage account and a blob container. And then upload a file. And then I package this script into a CLI using Python packages Click and Setuptools. I create a Github Actions workflow to build and run the Python script as a CLI command. Some of the code I have leveraged from MS Learn Azure SDK articles to build upon my own scenarios.
