# az-python
Python code with respect to Azure and AI scenarios for learning, sharing and proof of concepts.

This code are samples to complement the blog post series - https://roykim.ca/2023/11/13/step-by-step-using-azure-sdk-for-python-in-windows-vs-code-part-1/

I demonstrate using Azure SDK for Python to create a storage account and a blob container. And then upload a file. And then I package this script into a CLI using Python packages Click and Setuptools. I create a Github Actions workflow to build and run the Python script as a CLI command.
